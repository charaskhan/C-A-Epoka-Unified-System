Epoka Unified System (EUS)

Many students face challenges with meeting deadlines. They often struggle to keep pace with the numerous activities surrounding them. This difficulty arises from the substantial workload that students encounter daily.

Our system presents a solution to this issue by monitoring every activity, event, or deadline that students have. EUS achieves this by utilizing notifications as its primary method of communication with users. By employing this system, students will have access to all their information, which includes, but is not limited to, attendance, grades, courses, and timetables. Furthermore, users will be able to interact with professors through notifications.

The main goal of EUS is to offer an intuitive tool that students can use to manage their schedules effectively and engage with the professors of their selected courses. A significant emphasis is placed on personalization within EUS. Each student will have the option to choose which notifications they wish to receive and which course hours are displayed on their timetable. Conversely, EUS also provides professors with tools that simplify the process of determining which students receive their notifications, enhancing the overall experience of EUS by making it more specialized.
